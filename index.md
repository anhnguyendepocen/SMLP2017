## Welcome to The First Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology, 2017, 28 August - 1 September 2017


We are happy to announce The First Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology, to be held in Potsdam, Germany from August 28th to September 1st 2017. This first edition of the summer school will provide an introductory overview of frequentist and Bayesian statistics for linguists and psychologists. We will cover the necessary theoretical background for both statistical frameworks, and participants will get hands-on practice in learning to analyze real data sets.

## Curriculum

The summer school is intended for participants who have some data analysis experience (such as t-tests and simple linear models), but want to work with state-of-the-art frequentist and Bayesian methods.

We will mainly focus on modeling repeated measures data. We will discuss hierarchical modeling in detail, using the generalized linear mixed modeling framework as a starting point. We will use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Stan](mc-stan.org). Participants will be assumed to have a working knowledge of R; Stan will be taught from scratch. Everyone is expected to bring their own laptop computer.

The summer school will consist of lectures followed by hands-on exercises. Two evenings (Tuesday and Thursday) will have invited lectures; these lectures will be followed by an evening of merriment.

A related [one-day workshop will be held in Tuebingen on 17 Sept 2017](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~vasishth/courses/IntroStanFGME2017.html).

## Computing equipment and preparation for summer school

We assume that everyone has a basic knowledge of R.
Participants are expected to bring their own laptops. Wifi access will be available.

**Please make sure you have the current versions of R and RStudio installed on your computer by the time you start the summer school, and that you have the R packages rstan and rstanarm installed. To install rstan, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).**

## Dates, schedule, and slides

28 August - 1 September 2017 9AM-5PM, plus two invited lectures on the evenings of 29th August and 31st August 2017.

The schedule in its current form can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/vasishth/SMLP2017/blob/master/smlp2017schedule.pdf).

### Invited speakers for evening lectures

The evening lectures will be recorded and posted on youtube.

## Location

Neues Palais campus of the University of Potsdam, Haus 9, we will be using rooms 203, 205, 212, 114. Please come to room 114 on Monday at 9AM. See [here](SMLP2017/map_neues_palais_campus.pdf) for a campus map.

## Traveling to the University of Potsdam 

If you are staying in Berlin, we suggest taking a train to the station Bahnhof Park Sanssouci, and then walking to the campus (5-10 minutes). There are direct trains from Berlin zoo station (Berlin Zoologischer Garten) and Berlin's main station, Berlin Hauptbahnhof; the journey takes 27-35 minutes. If you are staying in Potsdam, buses from the Potsdam train station are an easy option.
Please use [bvg.de](http://www.bvg.de/en/) for planning your travel (by train or bus).
